# Migaku Japanese Addon fork without MOTD

This is an unofficial fork that contains the minimum delta to the [upstream](https://github.com/migaku-official/Migaku-Japanese-Addon) to remove the Message of the Day functionality (popup notifications on startup) and is otherwise 1:1 with the original. The code to display the MOTD still exists, but it's just disabled. It may be removed completely later.

Only submit bug reports here if you are still experiencing the notifications. All other bugs should be reported on the original repo or other official Migaku channels.

The remainder is the original Migaku Japanese Addon README
